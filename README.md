  <p>A Chrome extension for a slew of manipulations that I want to make to web pages for better use

<hr />

Sometimes, you just want to tweak the browser a bit, you know what I'm saying?

So that's what this extension is -- just a place where I can go to make tweaks to web pages that help me use them / the browser better.

These tweaks include:

- Adding a custom `console` logger function that I can use when debugging, where the logs stand out visually (e.g. by using emoji identifiers and coloring the logs themselves)
- Adding custom styles to an unfocused web page. This is really handy for me, as I need to know if the document has focus, so that I can use [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium#readme). (And when it doesn't have focus, I use [this little trick](https://abramczyk.dev/web-page-focus/) to get it back)

## Notes

- Right now, this repo and extension are quite "hodge-podgey". If it makes sense at a certain point, I might decide to separate functionality into separate extensions. At that point, maybe I'll publish them to see if they're useful to anyone else.
